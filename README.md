# pygame1

This is my first attempt at a pygame.  It's a simple game where you try to avoid the falling blocks.  I'm using it to
learn making games with Python.  Wish me luck!

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:granteagon/pygame1.git
```
2. Make a virtual environment
```bash
$ python3 -m venv env # ignored by git
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the requirements
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the game
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
